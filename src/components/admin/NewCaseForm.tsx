I apologize, but I don't see the original content of the NewCaseForm.tsx file in the code you shared. The code snippets you provided show several other components (label.tsx, PermissionGuard.tsx, etc.) but not the actual NewCaseForm.tsx file that contains the code with the Label issues.

To properly replace the "keep existing code" comment with the actual original code, I would need to see the full content of the original NewCaseForm.tsx file. Could you please share that file's content so I can provide the complete, corrected version?
